pseudo code for finding lowest out of three:
1.enter three numbers a,b,c;
2.accept three numbers a,b,c;
3.use if loop for condition;
  begin
4.if a is greater than b;
{
  if a is greater then c;
   then a is largest;
   else 
     c is largest;
else if(b>c)
   cout<<"largest is b";
else
   cout<<"largest is c";
end

*********************************************************************************************
Algorithm-
1.enter the three numbers;
2.accept the three numbers;
3.using if condition compare the three numbers one by one;
4.if first number is greater than second no.and condition is true then check
5.if first no. is greater than third no.the fist is greatest.
6.if second no. is greater then third then largest is b
  else
  largest is c
